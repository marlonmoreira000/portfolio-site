Deployed site: ??????

Remote repository: https://github.com/marlonmoreira000/portfolio-site`

## Description

This repository contains my first personal portfolio site. You can find all source files and presentation slides in this repository.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this site is to showcase my current web dev skills and projects to potential employers. It is also intended to provide a means of contact and a chance to practice my love for minimalistic design.

---

## Functionality / Features

The website features several key pages, all with responsive design implemented for optimum viewing on mobile, tablet and desktop. All pages are accessible from the navigation menu at the top of the page and links to my social accounts can be found in the footer of each page. Links to my resume can also be found on the landing page as well as the about me page.

All pages feature responsive layout design utilising flexbox and media queries. Consistent use of two imported Google fonts is also used, with specific fallback options for each.

- Significant use of Flexbox
- Use of semantic elements and comments make the code easy to follow.
- Code designed using the D.R.Y. principle.
- Animated titles on the landing page (using keyframes).
- Range of hover effects on links, buttons and images.
- Consistent use of colours and fonts to create coherency.
- Consistent use of design elements such as font and border styling.
- Reuseable components for navbars, buttons, cards and blog entries.
- Minimalistic design to create a sense of simplicity and aesthetics.
